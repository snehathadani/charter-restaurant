# Getting Started with the Restaurant App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Before you run the app remember to create a .env file in the root folder for this app which contains the following. 

`
REACT_APP_API_KEY="<API Key>"
`

This was done to avoid having to push the credentials into git.
